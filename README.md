üßë‚Äçüíª Always wanted to write good commit messages, but no time or patience?

Exclude lock files and handle large diffs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Telemetry

> To prioritize commands that have higher usage, I've set up Posthog to collect basic information about command runs (for now its just the name of the command). 

No personal data is collected other than a random uuid and some platform information.

You can see the event mechanism in [src/utils/events.ts](https://github.com/augiwan/tldev/blob/master/src/utils/events.ts) and an example track call in [src/commands/setup.ts](https://github.com/augiwan/tldev/blob/master/src/commands/setup.ts).

**Why platform info?**

I want to bundle as much functionality as possible for offline use, so information such as cpu and gpu counts and models can help analyze what portion of tldev users are capable of running AI models locally, and if it makes sense to bundle them along with this cli tool in the future.
